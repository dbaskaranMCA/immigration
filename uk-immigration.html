					<p class="text-justify">The UK is one of the World's most famous movement goals for individuals
						wishing to live and work in another nation. Be that as it may, the UK movement framework is
						prohibitive. Following the EU submission consequence of 23 June 2016 and the choice to leave the
						EU further changes have been made to the UK visa framework. As of late the UK Innovator visa and
						UK Start-Up visa plot have been presented.
					</p>

					<p class="text-justify">By and large you have to go under the UK level focused visa framework which
						estimates candidates against different rules intended to survey their qualification for a UK
						work or study visa. Most business related visa applications, for example, the Tier 2 visa
						conspire, just as Tier 4 examination visa applications, are currently made through this
						framework.

						Since 2010 the UK government has made a progression of changes to UK movement law so as to
						confine migration to the UK, particularly from outside of the EEA.</p>

					<p class="text-justify">While we are waiting for full details on the proposed Australian-style
						points-based system, there have been exciting developments of our own existing one! The main
						work category, Tier 2 sponsored work permit, was expanded in the autumn 2019 and made easier
						than ever. We didn’t think we’d be saying that after 10 years of draconian Tier 2 rules!

						You still need to look for a Tier 2 Sponsor, a UK-based company that is able to give you a job.
						A list of current Tier 2 sponsors can be found on the official Register but it is constantly
						updated because new companies are added all the time. </p>

					<p class="text-justify"><b>Option1 : </b> it remains very popular to come to the UK on another
						visa, such as Tier 4 Student or Tier 5, do some work, meet employers and secure a job offer from
						a company that is willing to sponsor you. If they don’t have a Tier 2 licence yet, we can help
						to secure one. It is also beneficial to obtain a degree from a UK university because you would
						have a qualification familiar to UK employers. For example, you can work part-time during terms
						and full-time on vacations including after completing your course; you can work full-time on
						Tier 5 YMS. When your visa is about to expire, your employer may not want to let you go! And
						with the plans to revive a Post-Study Work visa, we are indeed entering the great time to work
						in Britain! It used to be a 2-year visa allowing you to work, after which you could very likely
						secure sponsorship in the above-mentioned in-demand skilled jobs. If you are studying for a PhD,
						you could extend your stay under the Doctorate Extension Scheme, look for work, prove yourself
						and let Sponsor vouch for you after that and all the way to settlement in the UK. </p>
					<p class="text-justify">If this is your plan, we have vast experience in helping small and
						medium-size employers to hire a migrant. We can work with you and your employer at the same
						time, from analysing a job (whether it qualifies) to Sponsor Licence application, requesting a
						certificate of sponsorship and all the way to the actual Tier 2 visa. </p>

					<p class="text-justify"><b>Option 2:</b> your overseas employer may transfer you to their branch in
						the UK.
						With so many jobs added on the Shortage List, meaning employers don’t need to seek settled
						workers first, it will be quicker and easier for the British companies to transfer staff. Avoid
						Tier 2 Intra-Company Transfer, if possible, as it doesn’t lead to settlement. This route is
						especially useful for IT workers, engineers as well as non-shortage professionals, such as
						accountants.</p>

					<p class="text-justify"><b>Option 3:</b> You can apply for jobs from abroad in most in-demand
						occupations, such as medical
						professionals including nurses, veterinarians, IT workers, engineers, architects, social
						workers, occupational therapists, artists, almost all scientists, teachers (maths, physics,
						computer science and Mandarin) and many others. If you work in the IT and digital technology
						sector, there is a great shortage of programmers, software developers, web-designers, business
						analysts, cyber security specialists. Graphic designers are also welcome! With IT workers, there
						is a trend where you might have been doing work for a UK technology company remotely, as a
						freelancer, and they would now like you to work full-time for them in the UK. Again, if your
						Sponsor doesn’t have a licence yet, we can help to obtain it.</p>
					<p class="text-justify"> <b>Option 4:</b> wait and apply under the new points-based system from 1
						January 2021. It is
						very
						exciting and it will open the doors to more workers from all over the world, not just Europe.
						You can start looking for a job and a Sponsor now with the view of submitting an application as
						soon as possible in 2021. Under the new system, jobs at a lower skill level (Level 3, see more
						below) will be acceptable, without the need for employers to look for settled workers before
						employing a migrant, plus there will be no annual limit on the incoming workers (i.e. no
						restricted certificates). </p>
					<p>Please see below for detailed information on each visa type.</p>
					<h4>Work visas </h4>
					<p class="text-justify">The UK has a points-based system which controls the flow of workers going
						into the country. Whether it is possible to obtain a work visa depends on your profession, your
						nationality and other factors. EU citizens can live and work freely in the UK.

						UK work visas are divided into different tiers depending on the type of work a person wishes to
						carry out in the UK. The most common types of UK work visas are the following:</p>
					<p class="text-justify">The UK has a focuses based framework which controls the progression of
						laborers going into the
						nation. Regardless of whether it is conceivable to get a work visa relies upon your calling,
						your nationality and different elements. EU residents can live and work uninhibitedly in the UK.

						UK work visas are partitioned into various levels relying upon the sort of work an individual
						wishes to do in the UK. The most well-known kinds of UK work visas are the accompanying:</p>

					<p class="text-justify"><b>Tier 1 (Exceptional Talent):</b> For those perceived as pioneers inside
						their fields.

						Not many of these visas are given every year.</p>

					<p class="text-justify"><b>Tier 2 (Skilled Workers):</b> For individuals extended to a talented
						employment opportunity with a compensation of at any rate £25,000.</p>
					<p class="text-justify"><b>Tier 2 (Intra-organization Transfer):</b> For laborers offered an
						exchange to a
						UK part of their present organization.</p>

					<p class="text-justify"><b>Tier 2 (Minister of Religion):</b> For individuals extended to an
						employment
						opportunity inside a confidence network.</p>
					<p class="text-justify"><b>Tier 2 (Sportsperson):</b> For first class sportspeople or mentors who
						have been supported by their
						game's administering body.</p>

					<p class="text-just"><b>Tier 5 (Temporary Worker):</b> For those needing to accomplish brief work as
						a cause laborer, sportsperson, imaginative specialist, strict specialist, on an administration
						approved trade or as a feature of a global understanding.


					</p>
					<p class="text-justify"><b>Tier 5 (Youth Mobility Scheme) </b> For youngsters matured between 18-30
						from
						Australia, New Zealand,
						Canada, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Monaco.


					</p>
					<p class="text-justify"><b>Tier 1 </b> visa applications can be made in the accompanying conditions.
						If you don't mind note that since 29 March 2019 the Tier 1 business visionary visa conspire has
						been supplanted by the UK
						Innovator visa plot and since 6 July 2019 the Tier 1 Graduate Entrepreneur Scheme has been
						supplanted by the Start-Up visa plot. A level 1 speculator can pick up passage dependent on
						venture assets of £2 million to contribute. Moreover, few individuals can go under the Global
						Talent visa class which supplanted the past Tier 1 extraordinary ability visa classification.
					</p>
					<h4 class="text-justify">Tier 1 Visa Overview</h4>
					<h5>classifications : </h5>

						accessible to put resources

						to fill a skilled job
						vacancy; including in a wide range of skilled occupations including in IT, accountancy,

						2 visa applicants must have a job offer and a Tier 2 Certificate of Sponsorship from a UK
						employer with a valid Tier 2 sponsor licence.</p>
